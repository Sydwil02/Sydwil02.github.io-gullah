    <p><span>An Authentic Culture of the Sea Islands Gullah is the West African based system of traditions, customs, beliefs, art forms and family life that have survived centuries of slavery and more than a century of free lifestyle. It is the Unique Culture of enslaved West African who inhabit the Sea Islands of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida prior and since the Civil War. As a whole, this area is known as the Gullah Geechee Corridor. The culture thrives throughout the corridor, which includes Hilton Head Island. Gullah Heritage works to share the values of the culture with the world through Hilton head activities. Tour Guides all of Gullah Heritage, who were born and raised on Hilton Head Island before the bridge connection to the mainland, share their expertise with tour participants to provide the most accurate and engaging cultural experience. The Gullah people are known for preserving more of their African linguistic and cultural heritage than any other African-American community in the United States. The language is an English-based creole language that contains many African loanwords and significant influences from African languages in grammar and sentence structure. There are plenty of things to do in Hilton head so if you are interested in learning more about the culture and Gullah Heritage Trail Tours, explore our website!</span></p>
