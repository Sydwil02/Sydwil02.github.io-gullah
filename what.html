<td align="left" valign="top">Most traditional Gullah neighborhoods in the Sea Islands are uniquely autonomous, similar to their ancestral villages in West Africa. Historically, Gullah neighborhoods contained clustered extended families, a Praise House, essential skill bearers, spiritual leaders, food processing mills, and access to the waterway. Together these qualities ensured sustainability. Like other Sea Islands, Hilton Head Island exemplifies this phenomenon in its villages that were established in the late 1860’s:<br><br><ul>
  <li><b> Stoney </b>– The gateway to Hilton Head Island that was once known as “downtown Hilton Head.”</li>
  <li><b>Jonesville</b> – Known for its wheelwrights and shoemakers and also had businessmen and carpenters.</li>
  <li><b>Spanish Wells</b> – Extends from the river used by Spanish explorers who came ashore. Its residents are known for their fishing, crabbing, and oyster harvesting in the Broad Creek.</li>
  <li><b>Gardner Marshland</b> – This neighborhood is a part of large acreage purchased by an African American immediately following the Civil War. Today, an extended Gullah family occupies a portion of the land. However, much of the original purchase has become a private community.</li>
  <li><b> Simmons Fishing Camp</b> – Was established around 1928 as the site of the embarkation point of transportation to Savannah. The original dock and building were rebuilt to accommodate visitors and fisherman.</li>
  <li><b>Chaplin</b> – Named for one of the Planters families whose lifestyle focused on farming and fishing. Basket weavers and fishnet makers were distinguished residents.</li>
  <li><b>Union Cemetery</b> – Established during the Civil War for Black Union soldiers, this cemetery has remained active ever since.</li>
  <li><b> Queen Chapel AME Church</b> – The site of one of the first AME Church organizations in South Caroline when, in 1865, a group of African Americans landed on the beach at Mitchellville and organized a church under oak trees at this site.</li>
  <li><b>First African Baptist Church</b> – Organized in 1862 in Mitchellville, it was the first church for free African Americans on Hilton Head Island.</li>
  <li><b>Squire Pope</b> – Gum Tree Road is perhaps the largest Gullah neighborhood in population and area on Hilton Head Island. Families of this neighborhood were once distinguished famers and shrimp boat captains.</li>

<h2 style="color:lavendar;background-color:orange;font-size:30px;text-align:center;"> Mitchelville</h2>
<td align="left" valign="top"><img src="http://gullaheritage.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mitchelville-seating-300x218.jpg"></td>
<td align="left" valign="top">In 1862, shortly after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed, the people of Mitchelville were busy creating a completely new, self-governed culture that would be the guidepost for generations to follow.
These new citizens built homes on neatly arranged streets, elected their own officials, developed laws, built an economy, and implemented mandatory education for their children. In fact, the reports of the success of Mitchelville were so glowing, that the famous Underground Railroad freedom fighter, Harriet Tubman, was sent to Hilton Head to see this bustling town, so she could share the story of Mitchelville’s self-governed success with future freedmen towns.

Situated on Hilton Head Island, SC, Mitchelville represents a jewel within the Gullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor that forms the roots of the African-American’s contribution to the heritage of freedom in America.</td>

<td align="left" valign="top">During the late 1940’s, many Gullah neighborhoods had established popular, rustic dance halls with music, food, and drinks known as juke joints. Juke joints became popular when the mainland entertainment technology reached the Sea Islands.A portion of the 12 mile stretch of Hilton Head Island beach was traditionally used by Gullah families for church picnics and fishing before resort development.</td>

<td align="left" valign="top">The Gullah Heritage Trail Tour passes by this historic museum during the tour route!

The Gullah Museum of Hilton Head Island is a non-profit organization that was established to preserve Gullah history, culture, customs, traditions, language, stories, songs and structures on Hilton Head Island.

Louise Miller Cohen and the Board of Directors of the Gullah Museum of Hilton Head Island are supervising the restoration of “The Little House” on Gumtree Road which is on land that was purchased by Louise’s great-grandfather, William Simmons, after the Civil War. The house was built in 1930 for Mr. Simmons’ grandson, William “Duey” Simmons, whom Mr. Simmons had raised.

The plan is to include this house and a new museum building to create the Gullah Museum of Hilton Head Island. The site is large enough to accommodate a visitor/welcome center, with a large meeting room that will also serve as a Gullah art gallery; a garden; a Praise House; and other structures.</td>
